Hello! I'm Brian, a software engineer working remotely from Chicago, IL.


I’ve solved some interesting problems:
* I helped improve graduation outcomes for students through better math homework software
* I worked to simplify the commercial real estate industry through better software tooling
* I am currently working to help merchants of all sizes from the board game shop on up understand their data 


I’ve shipped with the following tools:
* Typescript, LitElement, Golang, Protobufs, GCP App Engine, and Firebase
* React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, MySQL, and AWS
* Java, Kubernetes, gRPC, Bazel, on-prem, GCP, and AWS.


I’m making the world a little bit better through software.
