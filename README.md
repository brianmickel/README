Hello! I'm Brian, a software engineer working remotely from Chicago, IL.


I’ve solved some interesting problems:
* I helped improve graduation outcomes for students through better math homework software
* I built tooling to simplify the syndication mess for commercial real estate brokers
* I help merchants of all sizes understand their sales 


I’ve shipped with the following tools:
* Typescript, LitElement, Golang, Protobufs, GCP App Engine, and Firebase
* React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, MySQL, and AWS
* Java, Kubernetes, gRPC, Bazel, GCP, and AWS.
