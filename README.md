Hello! I'm Brian, a software engineer working remotely from Chicago, IL.


I’ve had some great opportunities in software:
* I’ve helped improve graduation outcomes for students through better math homework software
* I’ve worked to simplify the commercial real estate industry through better software tooling
* I am currently working to help merchants of all sizes from the board game shop on up understand their data 


I’ve been able to work with the following tools in production:
* Typescript, LitElement, Golang, Protobufs, GCP App Engine and Firebase
* React, Redux, Ruby on Rails, MySQL, and AWS
* Java, Kubernetes, gRPC, Bazel, as well as cloud platforms like GCP and AWS.


I’m making the world a little bit brighter through software.
